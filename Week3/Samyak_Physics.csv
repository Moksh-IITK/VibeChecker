My article (and picture) was featured on the cover of Nature.,"My group's article was accepted in Nature, which was a huge achievement for us theoretical physicists, since they don't often publish stuff like this (the last two primarily hep-th papers in Nature were in 2023 and 2010!). You can suggest a cover photo when you get accepted, and I submitted a visualization that I posted to this subreddit a few months ago, which somehow got accepted too. I ordered a physical copy just to be able to see this :D
You can see the article (open-access) here:

arxiv modeling the spread of COVID-19.
Many of these are relatively simple papers clearly written by physicists using simple SIR models, some basic curve fitting, and even Ising models to model the spread of COVID-19.
I'm writing to ask you, from the bottom of my heart, to
cut that shit out.
This is not an unexplained X-ray line from the galactic center. This is not the 750 GeV diphoton excess. This is not something where the first paper to correctly guess the peak number of COVID-19 cases on the arxiv gets a Nobel prize. People's lives are at stake and you're not helping.
At best, you make physicists look bad. Epidemiology, as a field, already exists. Any prediction from a physicist tinkering with equations pulled from Wikipedia is not going to be a better prediction than that of professional public health experts whose models are far more sophisticated and already validated.
At worst, people die.
I'm serious. Let's imagine the outcome of one of these hobby papers. Suppose Dr. Jones from ABC University dusts off an SIR code he wrote for a class project in grad school, and using some numbers from the CDC finds that approximately 10% of the world catches the disease. The paper assumes a few percent die, which means millions dead. Dr. Jones puts it up on the arxiv. Tomorrow's headline? ""Physicists calculate 3 million Americans dead of COVID by July, predicts 100 million cases!"" What happens after that? People panic. And when people panic, they make bad decisions. Those bad decisions can kill people.
Yes, I am literally suggesting that your paper on the arxiv might kill someone. This is already happening with the daily news cycle. Bad information gets disseminated, people get scared, and they react in the worst possible way. With your credentials you have the ability to create enormously powerful disinformation.
Don't believe me? Reporters watch the arxiv for things to report on. Those reporters are not scientists. All they know is that a scientist said something, so it's fair game to put in a headline. The public is even less scientifically literate than those reporters, and when a person with credentials says something scary a very large number of people take it at face value. To many people, 'Ising Model' only means 'algorithm equation calculus that says we're gonna die' because they are not physicists. You run the risk of becoming exactly the kind of disinformation and obfuscation that exacerbates the ongoing crisis. You become a punchline to a denier that says, ""They can't decide if there's going to be hundred thousand cases or a hundred million cases! Scientists don't know anything!""
Consider the pros and cons. The pros? You aren't going to contribute to the understanding of the crisis with a first order model you cooked up in a few days. The benefit of one preprint to your tenure packet is minimal (and most universities are adjusting their tenure process so that this semester won't penalize you). The cons? I hope I've convinced you by now that there can be serious consequences.
What's the alternative to this conversation we're having right now? In a year, we'll be talking about the time a pundit got on air, referenced a 'physicist's calculation that predicts 3 million dead by July,' and people panicked. We'll be talking about what we can do differently in the future. We'll be discussing requiring an ethics seminar for graduate students (like
every other field!
). We'll be talking about what sort of ethics surround putting out a preprint outside our immediate area of expertise during 
a major public health crisis.
I'd like to live in a world where people are reasonable, and where it's safe to share ideas and calculations freely. I'd like to live in the world where the public will listen to us when we explain which numbers are fun afternoon projects from physicists and which are the current best projections by major public health organizations. We don't live in that world. Please, be pragmatic about this, and don't put that paper on the arxiv.",
