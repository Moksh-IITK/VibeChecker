The robot itself runs on two So-101 units, which I control using two additional So-101s.
On the software side, I’m using Phosphobot’s program to handle everything.
For those curious about the head and control system: it’s based on a design by YouTuber MaxImagination, originally intended for RC cars — I described it in more detail in my last post.
The arms are still a bit shaky, and the robot tends to swing, which makes the camera feed a little shaky as well — but those are problems for another time.
I’ll keep you posted with further progress!",

after a lot of work (starting with zero knowledge), im glad that it's walking. the inverse kinematics is very general, so i can adapt it to any hexapod dimensions and i can easily design new gaits.
the next steps will be to continue to refine the firmware, spend (EVEN MORE) money to make it battery powered, add remote control and polish the design a bit.
im really proud of achieving this as a beginner, but constructive criticism is still welcome.",

The Incident:

The Failure:
The planner technically worked (it didn't hit anyone) but it completely failed to read the room. It highlights that
current AVs
have zero concept of danger or social context beyond basic geometry.
Outcome:
Passengers were safe, but officers had to shout commands at a car that couldn't understand the urgency.

Smart Sensing:
Beyond just driving, it collects real-time data on

Endurance:

Mehdi Alizadeh
and thought it was a brilliant example of upcycling.
Most hobby robots require buying separate expensive modules (Microcontroller, IMU, Vision Camera, WiFi Module). This project replaces all of that with a single used smartphone.
Why it's smart engineering:
Active Stabilization:
As seen in the video, it uses the phone's internal IMU (Accelerometer/Gyro) to keep the chassis perfectly level, even while walking.
Compute:
It leverages the phone's CPU/GPU to handle the Inverse Kinematics (IK) and gait calculations.
Vision & Comms:
It gets high-res cameras, GPS and WiFi/Cellular connectivity for free.
It essentially turns e-waste into a high-performance robot controller.

Here are the first results of a little bot i’m working on for one year.
Some specs:
- powered by a teensy 4.0
- 300 mah battery 
- dc motors with encoders 
- round LCD
- 2 x 2 gr servo motors
- tof sensor, amg 8833 thermal camera (motorized behind the screen), mpu6050.
- mono speacker
I also made a 3D rig in 3ds max to animate and synchronise all the motors/screen animations and sounds. Still a lot to do but i’m really happy to see it move!",
